The analysis of rainfall is of great importance in terms of water resources management, human life and their environment. Trend analysis of monthly, annual and seasonal rainfall for selected 30 years (1990 - 2019) is carried out. Mann-Kendall test and Sen’s slope estimation methods are used to study the trend. Different machine learning regression algorithms are also compared by calculating errors to find the more accurate one for rainfall analysis in future.
